## 🎯 Vision & Philosophy
The **dev-blueprint** is not just a collection of code. It is a systematic approach to learning. 
* **Atomic Learning:** Breaking complex systems into small, digestible parts.
* **Documentation First:** If I can't explain it in the README, I don't understand the code.
* **Public Accountability:** Building in the open to invite critique and growth.

## 📏 Engineering Guidelines
1. **Clean Code:** Variable names must be descriptive (e.g., `user_account_balance` instead of `uab`).
2. **Atomic Commits:** Each Git commit should do exactly one thing.
3. **DRY:** Don't Repeat Yourself. Abstract repetitive logic into modules.
4. **KISS:** Keep It Simple, Stupid. Avoid over-engineering.

---

## 📖 Glossary of Terms
* **API:** Application Programming Interface. How programs talk to each other.
* **Boolean:** A data type with two values: True or False.
* **CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, Delete. The four basic functions of persistent storage.
* **Deployment:** Moving code from a local machine to a live server.
* **Framework:** A collection of tools that provide a structure for building apps.
* **Middleware:** Software that acts as a bridge between an OS or database and an application.
